    "\n",
    "Functions are the primary and most important method of code organization and reuse in Python. As a rule of thumb, if you anticipate needing to repeat the same or very similar code more than once, it may be worth writing a reusable function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can also help make your code more <span style=\"color:red\">readable</span> by giving a name to a group of Python statements. Functions are declared with the def keyword and returned from with the return keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function(x, y, z=1.5):    \n",
    "        if z > 1:        \n",

    "        else:        \n",
    "            return z / (x + y)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no issue with having multiple return statements. If Python reaches the end of a function without encountering a return statement, None is returned automatically. Each function can have positional arguments and keyword arguments. Keyword arguments are most commonly used to specify default values or optional arguments. In the preceding function, x and y are positional arguments while z is a keyword argument. This means that the function can be called in any of these ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_function(5, 6, z=0.7) \n",
    "    my_function(3.14, 7, 3.5) \n",
    "    my_function(10, 20) \n",
    "    \n",
    "The main restriction on function arguments is that the keyword arguments must follow the positional arguments (if any). You can specify keyword arguments in any order; this frees you from having to remember which order the function arguments were specified in and only what their names are.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use keywords for passing positional arguments as well. In the preceding example, we could also have written: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    my_function(x=5, y=6, z=7) \n",
    "    my_function(y=6, x=5, z=7) \n",

    "Functions can access variables in two different scopes: global and local. An alternative and more descriptive name describing a variable scope in Python is a namespace. Any variables that are assigned within a function by default are assigned to the local namespace. The local namespace is created when the function is called and immediately populated by the function’s arguments. After the function is finished, the local namespace is destroyed (with some exceptions that are outside the purview of this chapter). Consider the following function:\n",

    "            a.append(i) \n",
    "            \n",
    "When func() is called, the empty list _a_ is created, five elements are appended, and then _a_ is destroyed when the function exits. Suppose instead we had declared _a_ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a = [] \n",

    "In data analysis and other scientific applications, you may find yourself doing this often. What’s happening here is that the function is actually just returning one object, namely a tuple, which is then being unpacked into the result variables. In the preceding example, we could have done this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "    return_value = f() \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this case, return_value would be a 3-tuple with the three returned variables. A potentially attractive alternative to returning multiple values like before might be to return a dict instead:\n",
